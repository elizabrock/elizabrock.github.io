Currently, my biggest project in life is raising my two beloved daughters, Gwen (3 1/2) and Fiona (1).  Outside of work, most of my technology projects revolve around my children, which (in my mind, at least) is as it should be.

## Active Undertakings

1. Parenting :heart_eyes:
2. [eCommerce Engineering Manager at Tuft & Needle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabrock/)
3. Author of [Gwen's Cookbook](https://gwenscookbook.com), a pictorial cookbook I made my eldest daughter for Christmas 2019
3. Co-founder (along with my husband) of [Miniature Caravan](https://www.miniaturecarvan.com), which will soon feature writings on the intersection of our work as both parents and technologists.  This has been a work-in-progress for us for a while, and like most of life, is delayed by the pandemic.
