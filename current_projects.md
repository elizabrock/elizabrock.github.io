Currently, my biggest project in life is raising my two beloved daughters, Gwen (6) and Fiona (3 1/2).  Outside of work, most of my technology projects revolve around my children, which (in my mind, at least) is as it should be.

## Active Undertakings

1. Parenting :heart_eyes:
2. [Visiting Assistant Professor at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabrock/)
3. Co-founder (along with my husband) of a nascent startup/real business.  This has been a work-in-progress for us for a while, and like most of life, was much delayed by the pandemic.
