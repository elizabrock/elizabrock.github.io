about: |
  Savings Multiplied was a website where parents of multiples (twins, triplets or more!) could buy and sell gently used sets of clothes, find advice from other parents and obtain discount links.
goal: |
  The goal of this project was to take the Savings Multiplied concept from idea to launched website.
result: |
  I worked with Anne McGraw, the cofounder of Savings Multiplied, from start to finish on this project. I started by sitting down with Anne and discussing the company's vision and goals. From there, we wireframed a MVP (minimum viable product), and after that was approved we produced a list of features with user stories. We then developed the application for SavingsMultiplied, and maintained the application throughout the life of the company. Savings Multiplied shut down in 2012.
  Years later, Anne was gracious enough to allow me to use the wireframes and branding from Savings Multiplied as course materials in my software development courses.  Many of my students had a version of Savings Multiplied as one of the initial web applications that they developed.
