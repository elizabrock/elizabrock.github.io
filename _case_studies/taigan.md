about: |
  Taigan was an e-commerce portal for online boutiques. The team at Taigan scoured the globe in search of the most talented designers and unique products to bring customers the most comprehensive collection of extraordinary shops, passionate purveyors, and wonderful things. Their collection featured distinguished wineries, luxury boutiques, emerging designers, artisanal food purveyors, unique childrenâ€™s wear and more.
goal: |
  After 4 years of active development and a number of development teams (including myself in 2009/10), Taigan's ecommerce platform was suffering from performance and security issues. We were brought in to repair their test suite and get them onto the latest versions of Ruby and Rails.
result: |
  In 2013-2014 my team and I worked closely with Taigan to get their automated test suite running again, and then to upgrade their codebase from ruby 1.8 to ruby 1.9, and then from Rails 2.3 to Rails 3.2. We also helped Taigan interview their maintenance development team and subsequently worked with them as technical advisors. In previous projects (2009-2010) we implemented an updated shopping cart system and Taigan Gold, their premium membership service.
