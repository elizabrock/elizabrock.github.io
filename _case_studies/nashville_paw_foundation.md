about: |
  Nashville Paw Foundation was an organization that aimed to reduce pet overpopulation through the funding of effective spay and neuter programs and to promote pet adoption and animal welfare through positive community education. It funded various spay and neuter programs in our community, from mobile spay days for low-income families to special clinics for feral cats, pit bulls and more.
goal: |
  Nashville Paw Foundation needed a new web presence launched in advance of a media campaign. They choose Sitemason and Eliza Brock Software to produce the new site.
result: |
  We worked within the foundation's budget to produce a simple but meaningful website, which we launched ahead of their media campaign.
