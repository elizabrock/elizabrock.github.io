about: |
  MerchColony was an online directory of merchants: a search engine for what you need in Central Virginia. MerchColony.com made it easier for customers to find merchants, and for merchants to attract customers.
goal: |
  The goal of this project was to take the MerchColony concept from idea to launched website.
result: |
  I worked with MerchColony from the very beginning of story-carding and wire-framing through to their initial release. My employees and I maintained the application in production throughout the life of the company.
