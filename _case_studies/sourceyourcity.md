about: |
  SourceYourCity was a virtual community connecting local reporters with local experts to enhance the quality of local news through confidential news sourcing in real-time. It catered to three user-types: reporters, experts and PR professionals.
goal: |
  The goal of this project was to take the SourceYourCirty concept from idea to launched website.
result: |
  I worked with Neely Burks, the founder of SourceYourCity, from start to finish on this project. I started by sitting down with Neely and discussing the company's vision and goals. From there, we wireframed a MVP (minimum viable product) and after that was approved we produced a list of features with user stories. I then developed the web application behind SourceYourCity, and expanded and maintained the application throughout the life of the company. SourceYourCity shut down in 2012.
