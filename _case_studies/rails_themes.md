about: |
  RailsThemes.com sold beautiful, customizable themes for Rails applications.
goal: |
  The concept for RailsThemes was borne from a conversation between myself and my co-founder, Anthony Panozzo. One day, Anthony told me: "I just turned a generic theme into a Rails site. That sucked. I wish there were themes for Rails." And I said: "That's brilliant. We're doing it!" The goal was to provide developers beautiful designs sliced into valid HTML/CSS, customized for Rails with a 1-step command-line installer.
result: |
  Since inception, RailsThemes experienced an increasing web presence and growing customer base. There was an assortment of high quality offerings available, and the themes received rave reviews from clientele.  However, we chose to shut down the business after several years, to focus on other pursuits.
