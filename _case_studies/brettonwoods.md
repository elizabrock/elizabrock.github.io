about: |
  Mount Washington Resort is a ski resort located in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire.
goal: |
  brettonwoods.com is run by a Rails application that was initially developed in 2009. After losing their primary maintainer, Mount Washington Resort brought us in to make some fixes and improvements to the site.
result: |
  I revamped their ski trail and snow reports in preparation for the 2013 ski season. I continued to support the site as maintenance was required after that.
