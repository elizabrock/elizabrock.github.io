about: |
  SportsHedge was a sports gaming analytics platform that delivered high quality content to the sports gaming industry.
goal: |
  The founder of SportsHedge came to me as he was preparing to make their first technical hire.
result: |
  We interviewed their potential hires and provided them with a summary of the candidates and their technical skills. SportsHedge went on to hire the candidate we recommended and they were very pleased with that decision.

  We hired Eliza Brock Software to conduct a technical interview for our software development company in April 2012. After an initial call to gather requirements for the kind of candidate we were seeking, Eliza completed the technical portion of the interview with our applicant in a professional and timely manner. Her process of quickly identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the applicant has been invaluable to our Company, and lead us to hiring a great team member. I’d recommend Eliza’s services to any company looking to complete a professional and thorough technical interview.
