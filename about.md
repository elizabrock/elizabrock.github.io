  <h1>Who Am I? / About Me</h1>
  <p>I've been programming since around 2002. I've done a lot of things in that time, including teaching 200+ people how to program, and running my own software business for several years. When I'm not working, I'm usually hanging out with my kiddos (vintage '16 and '19) and/or working on home-tech projects that are interesting to me.</p>
  <p>Below, I've prepared a oh-so-serious list of professional skills, as well as a whimsical list of my life skills, because the little tidbits are what make up a whole person!</p>

  <h2>Informal Bio</h2>

    <p>I'm a software engineer, with experience in many areas.  I've worked with all sorts of companies and technologies, but my focus in recent years has been on Ruby on Rails, startups and education.</p>
    <p>I play well with others (see image) and I love meeting and working with new people. Nothing gives me more pleasure than learning something new from someone new.</p>
